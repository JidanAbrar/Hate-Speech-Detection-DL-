# Hate-Speech-Detection-DL-
The Hate Speech Detection Project employs a fine-tuned Tamil-BERT model to classify Tamil text as "Hate" or "Non-Hate." It includes a custom dataset class for tokenization, uses weighted cross-entropy loss for fine-tuning over 8 epochs with gradient accumulation, and splits data 80/20 for training/validation.
